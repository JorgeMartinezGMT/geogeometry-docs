Description
===========

GeoGeometry is a high-performance geometry processing library for geotechnical and mining applications.
It is not a pure Python package, relying on compiled extensions through libraries like NumPy and PyVista (which themselves use C/C++ backends) to ensure efficient numerical and 3D geometry operations.

        GeoGeometry is being developed by engineer Jorge Mart√≠nez as part of GMT
        to process and analyze geotechnical data. The project serves as the foundation
        for the GeoAssistant suite, a specialized geotechnical library.
